    Picanha is a highly underated cut of meat taken straight from the booty cheeks of the cow
    it's packed full of flvaor and is noticeable by its "fat cap" that it has on it.
    This dish is amazing to make on a grill so I'll explain how to do so here.

<h3>Steps, Boy</h3>

    Firstly, you want to cut your steak to proper sizes and I would reccommend about two fingers wide each cut 
    Next, season them with salt and pepper along with a bit of garlic powder and let those sit for a while as you get your fire started
    Once your coals are nice and grey to white your grill should be hot enough for the steaks, apply them to the grill for about a minute or two each side and take them off
    Finally, bring them to a skillet and butter baste them until they are to your liking, medium, medium rare or medium well
