Coat the chicken in the herbs, garlic, onion, salt, and pepper before coating them with flour and pan frying them to a gold color. Take them out of the skillet and then brown the garlic cloves with your herbs
Stir in the milk and creamer make sure to mix them in a manner of consistency that best suits your liking use the cornstarch for thickening the sauce and once it has reached desired thiccness lower the heat
Finally add in your chicken to the sauce mixture and let it thoroughly sink into the chicken and cook through all the way, add in extra herbs and salts pepper or whatever you desire at this point as the dish is pretty much complete and customizable, serve and dine!
